## Getting Started

To get started with CryptoFunding:

1. Clone the [backend repository](https://github.com/Trong-Tra/CryptoFunding.git).

2. Install node if you haven't (using along with yarn if it comfortable with you).

3. Either clone this repo or using it on your own application with the abi from the backend repo

4. Deploy network for the contract in the backend and change it with the current "contractAddress" in constant.js (if you have any change made in the backend please compile it and update the abi of the frontend).

5. Before putting it to use, start a local server to test some of the feature first using some decoy account (recommend importting to a metamask without any actual currency).

6. If you appreciate the design of my application, feel free to clone this repository and experience it firsthand.

## Security Considerations

-   Ensure that you deploy the contract on a secure Ethereum network.
-   Review and test the contract thoroughly to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
